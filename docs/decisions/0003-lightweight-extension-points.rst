Context

*******

.. This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.



Here we can add:

What instructors need and why (external response processing)

What's currently available in ORA to do so (instructor → configurations and what ora offers out of the box / developer POV → extension methods)

Decision

********

.. This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will …"

Here we can add:

Open extension points for plugin processing / interaction, no need for new step? how to argue that?

Or say: 1st step for new interactions outside ORA??

Consequences

************

.. This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.

Or say: 1st step for new interactions outside ORA??

Send data to services

Modify student steps? what are they call?

Rejected Alternatives

*********************

.. This section lists alternate options considered, described briefly, with pros and cons.

FOR THE MOMENT: a new step
